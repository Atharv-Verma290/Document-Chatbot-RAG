The Lighthouse Keeper's Secret

The wind howled against the old lighthouse, rattling its windows and echoing through the spiral staircase. Eliza, the lighthouse keeper, had lived alone on the rocky island for years, her only company the seabirds and crashing waves. She maintained the light with unwavering dedication, knowing the sailors depended on it to navigate the treacherous waters.

One stormy night, Eliza spotted a small boat struggling against the currents. She lit an extra lantern and hurried down to the shore. By the time she arrived, the boat had disappeared, but footprints in the wet sand led toward the lighthouse.

Inside, she found a man wrapped in a tattered cloak, his eyes filled with fear and exhaustion. He said his name was Samuel, and he claimed to be a sailor lost at sea for days. Eliza offered him food and a place to rest, but she couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. Samuel knew too much about the lighthouse — details she’d never shared with anyone.

That night, Eliza awoke to find Samuel standing by the lantern room, staring out at the dark ocean. He whispered names into the night — names of sailors who had drowned in the very waters the lighthouse guarded. When Eliza confronted him, he turned to her with a solemn expression.

"I was one of them," he said. "Your light saved me, but I can never leave."

As dawn broke, Samuel vanished like mist, leaving only wet footprints and a faint scent of salt. Eliza returned to her post, her heart heavy yet resolute, knowing her duty extended beyond the living.
